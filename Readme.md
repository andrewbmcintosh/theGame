The game that I chose to create for Project One is Connect Four. The game itself is played by dropping discs into a grid. The grid has a width of seven discs and a height of seven discs. The objective of the game is to get four of the same discs in a row. The catch is that the discs can only be placed by dropping them on top of one another and the players must alternate turns only dropping one disc at a time.

I did a lot of my planning for the project on the whiteboard as well as paper. The languages that I learned to create the game are HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, and Jquery. The programs and websites I used to get the images from and create are Adobe Photoshop, makewordart.com(for the WordArt), www199.lunapic.com(to fix the gif), and Imgur(to host the gif of the badger), the images for the badger and mushroom are images from the Badger Song created by Jonti Picking. 

The game has a few features. The game has a scoreboard that keeps track of the players score. The board clears itself when someone makes the winning move. The player discs are images.
